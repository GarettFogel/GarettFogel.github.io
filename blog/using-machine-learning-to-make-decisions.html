                        When you hear the phrase machine learning, your first thought may be complex models with
                        thousands of lines of code or even robots
                        learning how to outsmart humans to take over the world. I'm here to tell you machine learning
                        isn't neccesarily that complex or scary.
                        At its most basic level, machine learning is the idea that computers can make decisions based on
                        given data rather than being explicitly
                        programmed to make said decisions. Machine learning has applications in nearly every field and
                        is constantly expanding and improving.
                        It can be used by an investor to predict whether the price of a stock is going to go up or down
                        based on previous trends and the historical effects of
                        various outside influences. It can be used by a doctor to predict the likelyhood that a patient
                        has or will develop a disease based on their
                        symptoms and lifestyle compared to the symptoms and lifestyles of others. These machine learning
                        applications allow people to make smart, evidence based decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still a little intimidated by machine learning? Don't worry. I'm going to take you through a
                        very
                        simple text prediction machine learning script. This script will take an input
                        word and predict the three most likely words
                        to follow based on a set of training data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <div class="font-weight-bold">How Simple Text Prediction Works</div>
                        A machine learning model can be simple or complex, taking in as many factors as you see fit. For example, 
                        <a href = "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dc0f/cfffa7fc9e2e84598fa318c78987b57de1ed.pdf" target = "blank">
                        this clickbait detection model</a> tested for 7677 different features in each article in the set of training articles.
                        This text predition model is much simpler. It simply counts the number of times each bigram in the training data occurs.
                        A bigram is just a fancy word for two words together in order. For example, in the sentence "I am quite hungry", the
                        bigrams would be "I am", "am quite", and "quite hungry". By counting the frequency of each bigram, we can start to build
                        some tables for each word like the one below.
                    </p>
                    <table class="table">
                        <thead>
                          <tr>
                            <th scope="col">First Word</th>
                            <th scope="col">Second Word</th>
                            <th scope="col">Frequency</th>
                          </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                          <tr>
                            <td>I</td>
                            <td>can</td>
                            <td>58</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>I</td>
                            <td>will</td>
                            <td>77</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>I</td>
                            <td>run</td>
                            <td>21</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>I</td>
                            <td>am</td>
                            <td>104</td>
                          </tr>
                        </tbody>
                      </table>
                      <p>
                          After going through all of the training data and creating tables like the one above for every word in the set,
                          the user will be asked to input a word. The script will then find the top 3 most frequent words that followed
                          the inputted word. To continue with the example above, if the user were to input the word "I", they would be returned
                          the words "am", "will", "can". The words returned will differ based on the training data that provide to the model.
                          By training the model with one persons writing, the model can predict the most likely words that that person would
                          write next.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Obviously, this is a very simple model. It only takes into consideration the previous word when predicting the next word.
                          In order to make this a bit more accurate you could take into account a variety of other factors including current gramatical
                          tense, punctuation, and larger grams (such as trigrams).
                          For those interested, I'll show and discuss my code for simple text prediction. A basic understanding of python will be
                          helpful for understanding the following. If you'd like to download the entire script, you can get it

previousWord = ""
firstWords = dict()
                      </code></pre>
                      
                          In the beginning of the code we import all of the libraries and create all of the variables that we will need later.
                          In order to use this script, you will need a directory of .txt files to use as your training data. The script will
                          first ask you for the name of that directory. Files is the set
                          of all files within that directory. The previousWord varaible is set to blank
                          since the previous word to the first word is nothing. The firstWords variable is a dictionary where the key is the 
                          first word of a bigram, and the value is a list of dictionaries. The key for each dictionary in said list will
                          be each second word of the bigram, and the value will be the number of occurences of that bigram.
                          Using the above example, the data would look like this:
                      </p>

Heres where we get into the heart of machine learning: parsing through the training data and teaching the model
how to make predictions. In this section, we parse through each word of each line in each file. We "clean" the data by changing it all to lower case and removing all
punctuation. All we care about is the order of the words. In each iteration of the loop, the "previousWord" variable is the first word of the
the bigram, and the "word" variable is the second word of the bigram. If "previousWord" has been seen as the first word of a bigram, we
check to see if the full bigram has 
been seen. If it has, we increase the value by 1. If not, we add "word" to the list of bigrams starting with "previousWord", and set its vaule
to 1. If "previousWord" has NOT been seen as the first word of a bigram, we add it to the "firstWords" dictionary and add "word" to the list
of bigrams beginning with "previousWord", and set its value to 1.

                      From here the rest is pretty easy. We ask the user for a word. If that word has occured as the beginning of a bigram
                      we find the 3 second words with the highest number of occurences, and print them out to the user. Otherwise, we inform
                      the user that that word did not occur in the training data. The remainder of the code is standard trivial menu stuff to
                      repeat the prediction process.

                    <p>
                        As I stated before, this is an extremely simple text prediction model to help you get your feet wet with the world of
                        machine learning. To see how predictions change based on the training data, try training the model with books by different authors,
                        and see how predictions change based on whos writing has been used. The more training data you have, the better results you will get.
                        Feel free to add to my code to include other things such as trigrams, punctuation, or anything else you can think of to make more
                        accurate. Perhaps you could take in an entire phrase of input instead of just one word. If you do, let me know!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using this same process you could create models for all sorts of applications. For example if you own a car repair shop,
                        you could create a model that assocaites weather patterns with the types of repairs that occur during said weather.  
                        Given the recent weather, the model could predict what types of repairs are likely. As the shop owner, this information
                        would be helpful for making decisions in marketing and parts ordering.
